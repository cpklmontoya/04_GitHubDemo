        <p>This is where I'd put a succint but interesting about me. Maybe I'd talk about my music. Maybe I'll put a graphic in those images over there. Don't have a lot of pictures of myself. Should get on that. <br><br> Hopefully I'll find a way to tie work into it somehow. Here's hoping! k bye</p>
